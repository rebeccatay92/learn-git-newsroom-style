Sudoku --- The new craze sweeping the town!
Sudoku (数独? sūdoku, digit-single) (Listeni/suːˈdoʊkuː/, /-ˈdɒ-/, /sə-/,
originally called Number Place)[1] is a logic-based,[2][3] combinatorial[4]
number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so
that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the
grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits
from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for
a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.
